# Hand-Gesture-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Using-Python
A computer vision-based interactive game where players use real-time hand gestures to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against an AI opponent. The system captures video input from the webcam, detects hand gestures using contour detection or a trained model, and determines the winner based on traditional game rules.
ðŸ“Œ Features:
Real-time hand gesture recognition via webcam
Automatic detection of rock, paper, or scissors gesture
AI opponent with randomized moves
Live score tracking and result display
Intuitive and fun user experience
ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV (for image capture and gesture processing)
NumPy
MediaPipe (optional for accurate hand tracking)
Tkinter / OpenCV GUI (if interface included)
ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated:
Python Programming
Image Processing and Contour Analysis
Computer Vision and Gesture Recognition
Real-time Video Processing
Game Logic Implementation
ðŸŽ® Applications:
AI-based gesture control systems
Computer vision projects in education
Fun human-computer interaction demos
